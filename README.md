# IMDB Movie Suggestion

This Python script uses web scraping to suggest a movie from the top 250 movies on IMDB and provides a direct link to watch it online.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests-html` library

## Installation

You can install the required `requests-html` library using the following command:

```bash
pip install requests-html
```

## Usage

To run the script, navigate to the directory where the script is located and run the following command:

```bash
python imdb_movie_suggestion.py
```

The script will randomly select a movie from the top 250 movies on IMDB and display its name, duration, rating, release date, plot summary, and director. It will then prompt the user to watch the movie or not. If the user chooses to watch it, the script will provide a link to the movie on 1movieshd.com.
